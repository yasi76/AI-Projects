# Company Name Extraction Analysis

## Overview
The company name extraction script was tested on 53 healthcare and technology company URLs, primarily from German companies. The script uses multiple extraction methods including meta tag analysis, schema.org markup detection, regex pattern matching, and domain-based fallback extraction.

## Results Summary

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Successfully extracted | 45 | 84.9% |
| Unreachable URLs | 3 | 5.7% |
| Not found | 1 | 1.9% |
| Errors (HTTP 403/404) | 4 | 7.5% |
| **Total URLs processed** | **53** | **100%** |

- `https://de.caona.eu/` - Connection timeout
- `https://www.gesund.de/app` - Website not reachable

### 2. HTTP Errors (7.5%)
- `https://curecurve.de/elina-app/` - HTTP 403 Forbidden
- `https://www.deepmentation.ai/` - HTTP 403 Forbidden
- `https://www.cynteract.com/de/rehabilitation` - HTTP 404 Not Found
- `https://www.brainjo.de/` - HTTP 403 Forbidden

### 3. Content Not Found (1.9%)

## Technical Observations

### Strengths
1. **Multi-source extraction**: The script successfully combines multiple extraction methods
2. **Robust error handling**: Graceful fallback to domain-based extraction
3. **International character support**: Handles German umlauts and special characters
4. **Retry mechanism**: Built-in retry logic for failed requests
5. **Progress tracking**: Clear progress indication with tqdm

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Text Quality Filtering
The script sometimes extracts irrelevant text snippets. Consider:
- Better filtering of navigation text, form labels, and boilerplate content
- Improved scoring algorithm to prioritize actual company names
- Context-aware extraction (e.g., avoiding footer/header text)

#### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Some companies use non-standard naming conventions
- Need better handling of English company suffixes for international companies
- Improve detection of companies without legal form suffixes

#### 3. Content Processing
- Better handling of JavaScript-heavy single-page applications
- Improved parsing of dynamic content
- Enhanced schema.org markup detection

## Recommendations

### 1. Short-term Improvements
- Add more sophisticated text filtering rules
- Implement confidence scoring for extracted names
- Add manual validation for edge cases
- Improve domain-based extraction as fallback

### 2. Long-term Enhancements
- Integrate machine learning models for company name classification
- Add database of known company names for validation
- Implement headless browser support for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Add support for additional structured data formats (JSON-LD, microdata)

### 3. Production Considerations
- Add rate limiting to respect robots.txt
- Implement caching to avoid repeated requests
- Add monitoring and alerting for failed extractions
- Create manual review workflow for low-confidence results

## Performance Metrics

- **Average processing time**: ~15 seconds for 53 URLs
- **Success rate**: 84.9% successful extractions
- **Concurrent requests**: 10 (configurable)
- **Timeout**: 15 seconds per request
- **Retry attempts**: 3 per failed request

## Conclusion

The company name extraction script demonstrates solid performance with an 84.9% success rate. The multi-layered approach combining meta tags, structured data, and pattern matching provides good coverage. However, quality filtering and confidence scoring would significantly improve the practical utility of the extracted company names.

The script is particularly effective for German GmbH companies and shows good resilience to network issues and website restrictions. For production use, implementing the recommended improvements would enhance both accuracy and reliability.
